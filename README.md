Which Airport is better to fly out or in ? EWR,PHL or JFK

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights are available for the public. I have downloaded the raw data for the year 2016 for all the airlines for the tristate area airports EWR,PHL and JFK. I live in the tristate area. The purpose of my analysis is to find out the best airlines and airport to board or disembark a plane to avoid any delays and disrubtions.

The questions I have set to answer are

1. Which airport have the least arrival and departure delays.

2. Which Airlines have better performance and from which airport?

3. What are the type of delays high at each airport?

4. Which destination has the most departure delays by each airport?

5. Which airport sees the most arrival delays and from where?

6. Which day of the week is best to flyout to avoid delays?

7. Which day of the week is best to avoid arrival delays.
