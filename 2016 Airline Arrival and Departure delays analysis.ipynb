    "# Which Airport is better to fly out or in ?  EWR,PHL or JFK \n",

    "\n",
    "The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled and diverted flights are available for the public. I have downloaded the raw data for the year 2016 for all the airlines for the tristate area airports EWR,PHL and JFK. I live in the tristate area. The purpose of my analysis is to find out the best airlines and airport to board or disembark a plane to avoid any delays and disrubtions.\n",

    "This dataset is taken from Rita website. I have downloaded the csv files for each month of 2016 and combined them and then filtered data for the three airports I am intrested in Newark(EWR),Philadelphia(PHL) and Newyork(JFK). I cleaned the CSV files data by removing all the diverted flight information. I have also downloaded the longitude and lattitude for all the airports as csv files and joined with the ONTIME Performance table .\n",

    "As I said earlier I have started this project with a set of questions. I live in the Tristate area and thought this should be an useful visualization for any one in Tristate area looking to minmize the probablity of a delayed flight.\n",
    "I started by trying to find out how many flights are on time or not for each airport? If the flight was not on time what was the status ? Was it delayed ,Cancelled or diverted? From this I found when a flight was not on time most of the time it is because of a delayed flight. The next step was to drill down to see how each airline carrier measured in terms of flight delays for both Arrivals and Departures. The next step was to find out how Arrival and Departure delays are effected by a destination ? I also wanted to see if I am flying out or flying in which day of the week would minimize my probability of a delay. To represent all of these I considered different types of graphs but with the multiple categories and sub categories I had I found bar charts worked the best.  But I also wanted to show a geographical representation of each airport's domestic arrivals and dipartures by carriers and volume. \n",

    "# Feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 2 (based on feedback #1 and own improvements)\n",
    "\n",
    " First and foremost I had to make a lot of spelling and sizing adjustments on different screens based on the feedback. Most of the time the tooltip was displaying the column names so had to change them to readable names. Changed labels to make better sense(like changed week day to day of week). The colors I have chosen initially werenot uniform and since I was asked to see if I can make it more consistent I changed the color scheeme. I do think the changed color scheem is better. The one adjustment I didn't make is to change the colors of 7 weekdays. I received the complaint that it is too many colors. But I am not sure what is the alternative other than moving to pastel colors. I felt this as personal choice so left the colors in tact. One other question I have received is instead of having seperate graphs by numbers and percentages why not combine both for arrivals or departures.  The reason I had to keep them seperate is that I can only use one of the measure either the no of flights or the percentage of delayed flights when I am comparing between 3 airports . I can show the other measure in tool tip  but it wouldn't be the same . For example The arrival delays from LAX to JFK is higher by volume when compared to MCO to JFK but when you check the percentage of delays MCO delays are higher. So because of these reasons I have chosen to show these differences by different graphs.\n",

    "Version 3 (based on feedback #2 and own ideas)\n",
    "           When I shared my first revised version one of my friend asked Can I know what caused the delays of these flights? Is it the weather at fault or the carrier etc. As this was also one of my original questions but missed in incorporating the visulization I choose pie charts to do that and added on two more screens to depict that. I think the pie chart gives the readability at a glance that weather is a very small part of the delays.\n",

    "__1- Required: Great storytelling technique. To make the visualizations even more communicative, we can make the story captions more descriptive. In other words, besides asking questions or adding a title in the captions, I also suggest providing some findings and insight about the data. Check this story out as a sample. You can see that in this story the author is telling a story through the captions.__\n",

    "     from the   corresponding Airlines might be contributing to the higher number in delays. \n",
